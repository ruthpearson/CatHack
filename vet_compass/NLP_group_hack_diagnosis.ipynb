BOAS. Two pieces of skin: a) 26x20x8mm with a macule 10x10mm; inked green. 1TS through narrowest margins and 2LS. b) 20x15x25mm with a nodule 15x15mm; inked black. 1TS through narrowest margins and 2LS. 1 block. (VD/sl) MICROSCOPY: (a) The dermis contains a cystic structure lined by a single layer of squamous to cuboidal epithelial cells with relatively small uniform basal nuclei. Mitotic figures are inconspicuous. In places the cyst wall has ruptured and is replaced by a pyogranulomatous inflammatory reaction. (b) The dermis contains a circumscribed nodule composed of variably sized acinar; tubular and cystic structures; some of which contain intraluminal papillary ingrowths. These structures are lined by a single layer of relatively uniform cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells with occasional apical cytoplasmic blebbing. Mitotic figures are inconspicuous. . DIAGNOSIS: (a) Ruptured apocrine cyst with secondary inflammation (b) Apocrine sweat gland adenoma COMMENTS: (a); (b) Both of these lesions are benign; and may arise from the secretory or ductular portion of apocrine sweat gland. Rupture of the cystic structures may lead to a localised dermal inflammatory response. Complete excision should be curative. MARGINS: (a); (b) Excision appears complete.
