I have an environment called vetAI which I have provided the .yml file for.

At the top level of my CatHack directory I have a /Data folder (which is in .gitignore so that data doesn;t get added to git).  I recommend putting the data in the relevant directory on your computers with the following structure so that we all match:

/Data
  big_cats
  noah
  vet_compass
